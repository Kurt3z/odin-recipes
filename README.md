This is the first project in The Odin Project Curriculum

In this project I will showcase the knowledge acquired in The Odin Project
about the basics of HTML.
I'll show what I learnt about Elements and Tags, the HTML Boilerplate, how to work with text content, unordered and ordered lists, links and images.
This website consists of a main index page that'll have links to a few recipes.

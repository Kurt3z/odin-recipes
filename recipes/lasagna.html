        A special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato
        sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade
        lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but this recipe calls for a
        blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. Serve with a leafy
        green salad and crusty garlic bread.

      </ul>

      <h3 class="list-title">Steps</h3>
      <ol class="list-content">
        <li>
          Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high
          heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add
          onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley,
          garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and
          simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted
          water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring
          occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.
          Drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F&deg;
          (190 degrees C&deg;).
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon
          fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a
          9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles
          over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of
          the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers
          once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and
          mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and
          bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and
          serving.
